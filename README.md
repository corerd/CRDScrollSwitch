What are GitHub Pages
---------------------
On any regular repository, the **gh-pages** branch has a special meaning
for GitHub: any content pushed here, will automatically published to the
project GitHub Pages.
The instructions can be found at
[Creating Project Pages manually]
(https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually).

Since [git 1.7.10](https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/3/28/418) (April 2012)
git allows you to clone only one branch by means of the new `--single-branch`
option.
